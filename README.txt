This app is specificaly developed for my Ecovacs Deebot T9+, but can also be used on any Ecovacs Deebot with mopping system (the 950type devices).
This is app utilises the ecovacs-deebot.js library developed by mrbungle64, and is a fork of the Ecovas for Homey app by Olivier Messiant, extended with extra functions for Deebots with a mopping system.
